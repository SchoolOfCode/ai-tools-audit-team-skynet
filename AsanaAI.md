# Asana AI

 â€¢ What problems does this tool solve?

    It takes away thought processes on some decisions and gives clarity on vague projects and tasks, so the project manager doesn't need to think about who to assign tasks to.
    It can give a visual medium for tracking tasks processes, and how far along projects are and what is to be done next. 
    It collects your organisations information and tasks, and puts it all into one place. Simplifying projects to be easier to understand for teams. 

    Provides tailored bundles of how the organisation would like to keep track of projects. Visualised workflows in templates created by AI. 
    From what we've found, it seems to be fueled by AI in communications. Streamling colleage visibilty.
