# AI Report
This report provides a detailed analysis of AI tools available in 2024, focusing on tools designed for natural language processing, machine learning, and project mangament. The research was conducted to evaluate the current landscape of AI tools and identify the most suitable options for businesses looking to adopt AI technologies.


## The AI Chosen

The chosen AI tools consist of Microsoft AI, Splash AI and Asana AI management. Each tool was evaluated based on functionality, ease of use, and output provided. 

First of all, we chose Bing AI to compare it against the most popular AI chatbot, ChatGPT, as it stand out for its advanced communitave understanding, making it ideal for research. On the other hand, Google Cloud AI excels in data analytics and scalability, particularly for companies working with large datasets.

Also an area of consideration, we included Splash Pro which is a multimedia creation tool, in regards to entertainment. The use was very limited as the app is no longer support, howeveer the features did include a wide range of AI generated music, vocals, samples, intergrational tools. 

In regards to scalable businesses in corporate workplaces, Asana is one of the leading applications which can assist in workflow management, project management, and task delegation. 

## Comparison and Analysis

Our analysis revealed the following: 

Microsoft AI:
- This tool is an interactive and information based AI tool that can summarise key notes of a prompt and also give similar suggestions realating to initial input. 
- It's limitations is that it's compilation tool, while it can summarise, it will provide exisiting links to the desired information.
- It's uses are that it's a very good citation tool, ideal for students and professionals writing theses. 
- Also ideal for finding upcoming events with links to information about the events, and how to get to the recommened events. 

Splash AI: 
- generating sample music via use of twxt prompted questions, create vocals in with desired vocals characteristics (eg. sing like Charlie XCX) 
- Provides a direct commercial license to which can allow the to  user obtain the right to use a copyrighted song or recording  within their library on commercial project by obtaining permission directly from the legal rights holder.
- the limitation of this would be full ownership is held in the hands of the site owners, also that the sample do not have the ability to be edited within the platform and must be exported to a second party DAW.

Asana:
- It is a scalable workflow and project manager that can connect multiple third party apps (such as gmail. outlook, slack, onedrive etc.) in it's own platform
- The tools Asana provides take away frustrating thought processes and task delegation, where as a product like Monday.com does not have that feature implemented. 
- All though it's very scalable the cost in time and pirce of initialising the application can be cumbersome to large organisations.


Conclusion
-
In conclusion, for users looking to deeply utilise an AI chatbot Microsoft AI is not the tool to do so, however it has great capacity to be used as a citation tool for desired references and current events.
